# OnTime - Attendance Manager

In college life, every morning after sleep, what matters to us is "attendance". “Do I have
attendance so that I can leave my class for sleep? Do I have 75% attendance to appear for
exams?” OnTime will now take care of it. It will remember students’ classes time table, notify
their low attendance, classes needed to be attended to get 75%, classes that they can leave
and much more. They will only have to enter their time table of classes once and mark the
classes they attended on the app. It will take care of the rest. No need to worry when will the
ERP gets updated because they can now maintain their own record of attendance.
Maintaining the attendance would get easier and one burden they would get relief of college
life as there are many to carry.
